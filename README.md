# RideShare: An Uber-like App

## Project Overview
RideShare is a web application designed to facilitate ride-hailing between passengers and drivers. The application provides a platform for users to book rides, view available drivers, and manage their ride requests. Built with a clean interface and responsive design, RideShare utilizes Google Maps for real-time location tracking and routing, enhancing the user experience.

## Installation
To set up the RideShare application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rideshare.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd rideshare
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser:**
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

4. **Setup Google Maps API:**
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in both `index.html` and `driver.html` with your actual Google Maps API key. You can obtain one by following the [Google Maps Platform documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started).

## Usage
1. **For Passengers:**
   - Open `index.html` to access the RideShare booking interface.
   - Enter your pickup and drop-off locations, then click on "Find Ride".
   - A recommended driver will appear along with ride details.

2. **For Drivers:**
   - Open `driver.html` to access the driver dashboard.
   - Toggle your availability and accept or decline ride requests as they come in.

## Features
- Book rides with pickup and drop-off location inputs.
- Real-time mapping with Google Maps integration.
- Automatic location suggestions for easy input.
